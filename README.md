# ActivitiSimple
Simple Use of Activiti Java Workflow Engine

Activity is a "easy to use" "lightweight" java workflow engine with countless maven dependencies and no obvious straightforward way to run the basic examples. :)

Activiti 5.0 and 6.0 did have useable examples of embedded workflow engines. Activiti 7 does not. Seems their focus is on cloud services. So this project is a modest attempt at creating a boilerplate project that just embeds the engine and runs a simple workflow without the use of Spring.
